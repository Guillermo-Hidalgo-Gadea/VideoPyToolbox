# VideoPyToolbox
Play, compress, trim and concatenate videos in python using FFmpeg

## What is VideoPyToolbox?
This Toolbox is a python wrapper of a compilation of useful commands to play, compress and edit videos using ffmpeg.
Many video recordings in computer vision are not optimized for conventional media players due to large uncompressed sizes or incompatible video codecs (see [here](https://gitlab.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/ikn/syncflir) for such a video recording tool). FFplay can easily open and display the video file frame by frame.
When it comes to video compression, FFmpeg can be challenging to use over command line, specially in batch processing. This toolbox allows you to run pre-defined ffmpeg commands with a few mouse clicks from Tk interfaces right from the terminal.

## How to use VideoPyToolbox
The Toolbox is built as an interactive terminal prompt to guide you step by step through the process of concatenating, compressing, spliting and playing videos.
